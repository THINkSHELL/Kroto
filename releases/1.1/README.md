## Kroto

Kroto is a Rhinoceros3D (www.rhino3d.com/) and Grasshopper(grasshopper3d.com) tool aimed at form-finding membranes. Along with the classical minimal surface problem, it accurately solves external conditions such as cables, uniform pressure and vertical load forces.
It can run as a stand-alone RhinoPython script, or as a set of Grasshopper components (with GHPython).
It relies upon the membrane form-finding "stress density method", published here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141029697001089.

## Code Example

Usage examples will be coming soon.

## Motivation

By developping this tool, we hope to provide the 3D-modeling community with a tool that is backed by a physical solution to the membrane form-finding problem. We think that such tools should publish their source code in an effort to offer reliable physical softwares.

## Installation

Usage examples will be coming soon.

Install Rhinoceros3D, 5.0 minimum (http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/5/latest?PageSpeed=noscript)
Install Grasshopper, 0.9.0075 minimum (http://www.grasshopper3d.com/page/download-1)
Install GHPython (http://www.food4rhino.com/project/ghpython?etx)
Download, unpack in a folder, open example.gha in Grasshopper.
Alternatively, you can add all .py files to your Grasshopper 

## Tests

Example files: minimal surface hypar, inflated pillow, ILEK, ...
