"""Implements the Stress Density Method as a Rhino mesh solver
Takes a problem defined as a triangular mesh (working with quadrangular
meshes as well would take a lot of rewrite), edges conditions and solver
options.

Returns a mesh close to a minimal surface. The result is a true minimal
surface if the edges are fixed, pressure null and the method iterated
until density coefficients yield a uniform stress field.
